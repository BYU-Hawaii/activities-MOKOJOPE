            <h2>Time to Cook!</h2>
            <p>Step 1: Use a mortar and pestle to pound the rehydrated shrimp until fine.</p>
            <p>Tip: Pound the shrimp in small batches rather than all at once.</p>
            <p>Step 2: Remove the head of the daikon and double peel them (peel the first layer off, then peel off another layer).</p>
            <p>Step 3: This step is vital for removing the bitterness and tougher layer found in the outer part of the vegetable.</p>
            <p>Step 4: Cut the daikon into large chunks, roughly 5cm (2″) wide.</p>
            <p>Step 5: Bring 1L (4 US cup) of water to a boil and add the daikon in to blanch for 2 minutes to further remove the bitterness</p>
            <p>Step 6: Drain the water and daikon, then bring a fresh 1 L (4 US cup) of water to a boil with 1/2 tbsp sugar.</p>
            <p>Step 7: Add the blanched daikon back in and cook for another 3 minutes, then pour all the contents into a bowl as you prepare the other ingredients.</p>
            <p>Step 8: Pour the oil into a wok on low-medium heat. Test to see if the oil is hot enough by putting a wooden utensil (such as a chopstick) into it.</p>
            <p>Step 9: If it bubbles, add the pounded shrimp in and brown for 5 minutes. If it doesn’t bubble, wait until it does before adding the shrimp.</p>
            <p>Step 10: Turn the heat up to medium and add the red shallots, ginger and garlic. Fry them for 3 minutes or until golden brown.</p>
            <p>Step 11: Reduce the heat to low and pour the curry powder, tumeric powder, curry paste, chu hou paste and sa cha sauce in and stir for 15 seconds.</p>
            <p>Step 12: Pour the Shaoxing rice wine in around the sauce and stir for 15 seconds.</p>
            <p>Step 13: Turn the heat up to high and pour the daikon in along with the water.</p>
            <p>Step 14: Throw in the chili and bay leaves, then let it simmer and braise for 3 minutes.</p>
            <p>Note: If you prefer it spicier, you can stir fry the chili and bay leaves when you cook the sauces. This will help to bring out the spice.</p>
            <p>Step 15: Pour the fried fish balls in and mix them through the sauce.</p>
            <p>Step 16: Season with salt, oyster sauce and sugar and let it braise for another 15 minutes or until soft.</p>
            <p>Step 17: Turn the heat to medium, stir the potato starch with water to make a starch slurry. When well combined, pour it slowly into the wok. Stir as you pour to avoid making clumps.</p>
            <p>Note: Adding the slurry is entirely optional and can be done according to your preference. If you like the sauce thicker, add more slurry in. If you prefer a thinner sauce, use less or skip it altogether.</p>
