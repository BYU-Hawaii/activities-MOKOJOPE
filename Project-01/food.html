        <p>The egg tart (traditional Chinese: 蛋撻; simplified Chinese: 蛋挞; Cantonese Yale: daahn tāat; pinyin: dàntǎ) is a kind of custard tart found in Chinese cuisine, derived from the English custard tart and Portuguese pastel de nata. The dish consists of an outer pastry crust filled with egg custard. Egg tarts are often served at dim sum restaurants, Chinese bakeries and cha chaan tengs (Hong Kong-style cafes).</p>
        <h2>Fish Balls</h2>

        <p>Fish balls are the balls made from fish paste which are then boiled or deep-fried. Similar in composition to fishcake, fish balls are often made from fish mince or surimi, salt, and a culinary binder such as tapioca flour, corn, or potato starch.</p>
        <h2>Egg Waffles</h2>

        <p>An egg waffle is a spherical egg-based waffle popular in Hong Kong and Macau,[1] consisting of an eggy leavened batter cooked between two plates of semi-spherical cells. They are usually served hot, and often eaten plain, although they may be served with fruit and flavors such as strawberry, coconut or chocolate.[2] It is referred to by its original Cantonese name, gai daan jai (雞蛋仔),[1] and in English, an egg puff, bubble waffle, eggette, pancake balls, pancake waffle, egglet, and puffle.[citation needed] They are sometimes referred to as Hong Kong cakes in Chinatowns across America, especially in New York.[3] One piece of egg waffle can have around 20 to 35 small round 'balls'.</p>
        <p>Egg waffles are among the most popular Hong Kong "street snacks" and were ranked No. 1 in a 100 most popular HK street snack listing.[4] They have been a favored street snack since their emergence in the 1950s, when they were made with coal fire heating and sold from street kiosks in Hong Kong.</p>
        <h2>Stinky Tofu</h2>

        <p>Stinky tofu (Chinese: 臭豆腐; pinyin: chòu dòufu) is a Chinese form of fermented tofu that has a strong odor. It is usually sold at night markets or roadside stands as a snack, or in lunch bars as a side dish, rather than in restaurants. Traditionally the dish is fermented in a brine with vegetables and meat, sometimes for months. Modern factory-produced stinky tofu is marinated in brine for one or two days to add odor.</p>
