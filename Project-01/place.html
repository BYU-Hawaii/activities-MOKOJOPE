            <p>Victoria Harbour is a natural landform harbour in Hong Kong separating Hong Kong Island in the south from the Kowloon Peninsula to the north. The harbour's deep, sheltered waters and strategic location on South China Sea were instrumental in Hong Kong's establishment as a British colony in 1841 and its subsequent development as a trading centre.</p>

            <p>Many roads on the Hong Kong Island conform to the contours of the hill landscape. Some of the roads on the north side of Hong Kong Island and southern Kowloon have a grid-like pattern.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8] The roads are generally designed to British standards. Expressways generally conform to British motorway standards.</p>
