        <h2>In the Past...</h2>
            <img src="IMAGES/oldhongkong.jpg" alt="The Picture of Old Hong Kong">
            <p>The region of Hong Kong has been inhabited since the Old Stone Age, later becoming part of the Chinese Empire with its loose incorporation into the Qin dynasty (221â€“206 BC). Starting out as a farming fishing village and salt production site, it became an important free port and eventually a major international financial center.</p>
            <p>In the early days, the village life in Hong Kong was simple, with traditional Chinese architectural styles predominating. The buildings, made primarily of wood and stone, reflected the practical needs and aesthetic values of the local population. These structures were often captured in the old black-and-white photographs of the era, which provide a glimpse into the daily lives and culture of Hong Kong's early inhabitants.</p>

            <p>Hong Kong's historical narrative is intricately tied to significant geopolitical events of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Qing dynasty's cession of Hong Kong to the British Empire in 1842 through the Treaty of Nanjing marked a pivotal moment in its history. This treaty, which concluded the First Opium War, resulted in Hong Kong becoming a British crown colony.</p>
            <p>Following the First Opium War, Britain's victory in the Second Opium War further reshaped the region's territorial landscape. The Qing Empire was compelled to cede Kowloon to Britain in 1860, expanding the territory under British control. However, it was the subsequent leasing of the New Territories in 1898 that profoundly impacted Hong Kong's future. Under the terms of the "Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory," Britain obtained a 99-year lease over the New Territories, significantly enlarging the colony's area and securing its strategic position.</p>
